Blocking
One process of the resource is locked by the another resource process.

To check the block 
- sp_who2
- ⁠select * from sys.sysprocess where blocked > 0
- ⁠sys.dm.exec.requests
- ⁠sys.dm.exec.sessions
- dbcc inputbuffer(57) -(this is used to check the complete details of that session) 

Things that we need to check first if there is blocking
⁠
Session id
Query
User
Hostname


Deadlocks
- When two process are trying to apply lock on each other mutually then deadlock will occur.

If u want to track deadlock u need to trace 1222 & 1204.

Traced flag - It is used to change the certain behaviour of the server.

- dbcc tracestatus - this command will show the trace flag enabled details.
- dbcc traceon(1222) - this command will apply the trace flag to 1222 
- ⁠(the above command traceon will only be applied to that session) 
- ⁠xp_errorlog - here u can find the deadlock information.
