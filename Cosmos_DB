Key features of Azure Cosmos db

Multi-Model Database:
Supports multiple data models, including document, key-value, graph, column-family, and table.
Allows developers to choose the most suitable data model for their application.

Global Distribution:
Enables data to be distributed across multiple Azure regions globally.
Provides low-latency data access for users regardless of their geographic location.

Multi-API Support:
Offers multiple APIs, including SQL (document), MongoDB, Cassandra, Gremlin (graph), and Azure Table Storage.
Allows developers to use their preferred API and data model.

Automatic and Instantaneous Scaling:
Scales both throughput and storage automatically based on demand.
Supports manual scaling for fine-grained control over resources.

Consistency Models:
Provides multiple consistency models, including strong, bounded staleness, session, and eventual consistency.
Allows developers to choose the level of consistency based on their application's requirements.

Serverless Option:
Offers a serverless option (Azure Cosmos DB serverless) where you pay only for the resources consumed by the database operations.
Suitable for occasional, unpredictable workloads.

CosmosDB structure 

Database accounts 
     |
Databases 
     |
Containers 
- store procedures
- ⁠items 
- ⁠user defined functions 
- ⁠merge procedures
- ⁠triggers 
- ⁠conflicts 


Requests units
- The cost of all the database operations is normalised by Azure CososDB and is expressed by request units 

Partitions
- In partitioning the items in a container are divided into distinct subsets called logical partitions.

1) Logical partition
2) Physical partition 

SQL API
- Azure cosmos DB SQL API accounts support quarrying items using SQL as a JSON query language.
